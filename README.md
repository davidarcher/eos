# Economies of Scale

Dedicated to the devoted fans of the game who have played this game for years and have requested for the source code to be made public.

If you are here because you are interested in programming, DO NOT READ ANY OF THE SOURCE CODE HERE, instead, start by using any of the following frameworks depending on your language of choice:

PHP - Laravel

JS - NodeJS + Sails for backend, AngularJS for frontend

Python - Django


# I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

This is the game I wrote near the start of my programming career. The code is procedural, unscalable, and you can feel the stench from a mile away. Much of the design was done with copy-and-paste. Since first writing the game, many functions used are now considered deprecated. It is possible that the game may stop working at all in a few more years.

On the other hand, programming for desktop browsers has gotten easier than ever due to new features in HTML5, CSS3, EcmaScript6, and the countless number of awesome UI libraries and new frameworks. If you'd like to make improvements to the game, I'd strongly recommend a complete rewrite using one of the aforementioned frameworks.

The game is currently still available to play at www.capitalism-online.com.
